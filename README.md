## Comments

I have made my portfolio website very simple. I want the whole focus to be on the work I have done. At this moment I have made the decision to wait with certain features. I will add social media icons and such later on when I start up new social media accounts. I am also planning on adding a more specific "about me" page and a "contact" page when I have more projects to show, and more ways to contact me.
